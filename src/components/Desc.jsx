              Companies that want to thrive in these competitive markets can improve their odds of success with the help
              of data analysis.

              This strategy is common sense, and it applies to personal life as well as business. No one makes important
              decisions without first finding out whatâ€™s at stake, the pros and cons, and the possible outcomes.
              Similarly, no company that wants to succeed should make decisions based on bad data. Organizations need
              information; they need data. This is where data analysis enters the picture.
